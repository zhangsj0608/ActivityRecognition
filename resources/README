WSU Smart Apartment ADL Normal Testbed

Description

These datasets represent sensor events collected in the WSU smart apartment
testbed.  The data represents participants performing five ADL activities
in the apartment.  The five tasks are:

   1:  Make a phone call.  The participant moves to the phone in the
       dining room, looks p a specific number in the phone book, dials
       the number, and listens to the message.  The recorded message provides
       cooking directions, which the participant summarizes on a notepad.

   2:  Wash hands.  The participant moves into the kitchen sink and washes
       his/her hands in the sink, using hand soap and drying their hands
       with a paper towel.

   3:  Cook.  The participant cooks a pot of oatmeal according to the directions
       given in the phone message.  To cook the oatmeal the participant must
       measure water, pour the water into a pot and boil it, add oats, then
       put the oatmeal into a bowl with raisins and brown sugar.

   4:  Eat.  The participant takes the oatmeal and a medicine container to the
       dining room and eats the food.

   5:  Clean.  The participant takes all of the dishes to the sink and cleans
       them with water and dish soap in the kitchen.

File format

The files are named according to the participant number and the task
number.  File p01.t1 thus represents the sensor data for participant 1
performing task 1.  There is one sensor event on each line of the files.
The event syntax is Date Time SensorID Value.

A separate file, data, contains all of the sensor events in one file.
Each activity is indicated by its name with a begin event and a corresponding
end event.

Sensor layouts

The sensor layout of the apartment is shown in
the files Chinook_3_Bedroom_TH.png and Chinook_Cabinet.png.
The sensors can be categorized by:

   M01..M26:  motion sensors
   I01..I05:  item sensors for oatmeal, raisins, brown sugar,
              bowl, measuring spoon
   I06:    medicine container sensor
   I07:    pot sensor
   I08:    phone book sensor
   D01:    cabinet sensor
   AD1-A:  water sensor
   AD1-B:  water sensor
   AD1-C:  burner sensor
   asterisk:  phone usage
